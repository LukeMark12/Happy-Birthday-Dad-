                <p>On your special day, I just want to say how grateful I am to have you as my father. Your love, wisdom, and support have shaped me into who I am today, and I couldn’t be more thankful.</p>
                <p>You’ve always been there for me, guiding me through life’s challenges and celebrating the good times. I admire your strength, kindness, and the way you live life with such grace.</p>
